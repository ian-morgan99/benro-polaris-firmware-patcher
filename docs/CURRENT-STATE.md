## 2026-09-25 convergence candidate

`o-v13b-direct-admission-20260925` is the current **INSTALLED, RUNTIME-VERIFIED,
CANARY-PENDING** replacement candidate. It embeds libgphoto2 `50ba50415`,
patcher `28c1a78`, and harness contract `a8b6581`; artifact bytes are privately
published at PrivateResearch `138ff20f7`. It retains the lower-layer admission
instrumentation and restores exact direct-to-core `gp_camera_capture` dispatch.
The sanctioned install verified all six staged manifest entries before reboot;
post-boot FwVer and embedded source provenance match the registered candidate.

The preceding o-v13 artifact was installed and failed two bounded first-shot
canaries: preview stopped and code 264 was accepted, but no shutter/completion/
773 followed and the session ended at `state:-10`. Runtime logs proved that
artifact still interposed the unsafe Stage-2 capture shim and never reached the
libgphoto2 admission trace. It is superseded; no second shutter was sent.

The next physical spend is deliberately one question: whether no active
exposure (+32) and no pending candidate (+36) safely admit a second ordinary
`InitiateCapture` while broad activity (+104) still reports unsafe. Exact
hashes, test results and the bounded acceptance run are in
`evidence/o-v13b-direct-admission-20260925/SUMMARY.md`.

## Installed candidate and protected fallback

As of 2026-09-24 the device has **o-v12n-companion-ownership**, build ID
`6.0.0.54.23-o-v12n-companion-ownership`, installed. It is a diagnostic
candidate, **not release-qualified**. Runtime provenance is libgphoto2
`ab0de090c` plus patcher `7bcbc39`; the registered artifact hashes are in
`FWPKT-PROVENANCE-CONTRACT.md`.

One K-3 III RAW-only first-shot canary completed with lifecycle `[1,4,0]` and
published `SP_0074.dng` (32,900,659 bytes). This proves only that one
single-output capture can complete. The same-session repeat-capture gate did
not pass: one run completed shot 1 (`SP_0078.dng`) and then lost the camera
before shot 2 was issued; a later run did not complete shot 1 and reported
`state:-10`. Do not describe o-v12n as fixing repeated capture.

The currently attached body is K-01 (`25fb:0131`). The normal product path
initializes it successfully as `pentax/k-01/state:1`; one still request
returned `-6` immediately, consistent with that separately gated model not
advertising capture support. This disproves the standalone Stage-2 CLI claim
that the package has zero supported cameras, but it does not qualify K-01 still
capture and says nothing about K-1 II. K-1 II remains **NOT TESTED** on o-v12n.

The immutable **o-v12l-recoverybaseline-20260923** artifact preserves
libgphoto2 `c0592d178`, the last source with physical first-capture Pixel Shift
RAW+JPEG completion evidence. It is privately published and registered but is
not installed and is not a final fix: its delayed companion/repeated-capture
behavior was not qualified.

The current review head is libgphoto2 `62402cc2c` on
`rescue/final-shutter-20260923`. It retains the o-v12n runtime behavior and
replaces the self-fulfilling ownership mock with a production helper used by
the real companion-publication callback. Focused Pentax tests and `ptp2.so`
compile pass. This is a source/test correction only; it does not justify a new
FwPkt until the o-v12n repeat-capture failure is understood.
The historical ledger and promotion matrix are in
`PENTAX-CAPTURE-VERSION-LEDGER-2026-09-23.md`.
The current audit and next-action boundary are in
`HANDOVER-2026-09-24-O-V12N-AUDIT.md`.

The protected last broadly repeated-capture baseline is **o-v9p capture isolation**, build
ID `6.0.0.54.7`. Its immutable artifact, hashes, source commits and private
location are recorded in `FWPKT-PROVENANCE-CONTRACT.md`.

Recorded K-3 III qualification passed ordinary capture, five unique
Astro-equivalent DNG captures, preview restoration with 15/15 complete JPEGs,
a final DNG, stable processes/listeners/USB and bounded DHD counters. Preserve
its separate preview and still-capture cooldowns and the package assertions
which prove the preview-throttle exports reached the final appfs.

This does **not** prove that physical focus direction, K-1 II, Canon R5 Mark II,
the packaged OpenPolaris GUI, indefinite soak, or the underlying Broadcom
driver exhaustion are fixed. Those remain open or unqualified.

## Repository state at issue #116 cleanup

On 2026-09-18, source commit `2b56e8d` recorded the Q build-id behavior. The
issue #116 hygiene pass restored the final-package assertions for P's preview
throttling and the isolated output mount used by the package regression test.
The unrelated `.vscode/settings.json` worktree edit was deliberately untouched.

No future source change is considered deployed without a registered immutable
FwPkt, verified hashes, supported install, cold reboot and post-boot runtime
proof.

## Hardware and release rules

- Read `.github/skills/polaris-debugging/SKILL.md` before live-device work.
- Use `.github/skills/fwpkt-update-flow/SKILL.md` for every firmware install.
- Do not replace binaries directly under `/app` as a supported fix.
- Keep direct libgphoto2, Polaris runtime and OpenPolaris E2E evidence separate.
- A protocol acknowledgement is not physical focus or capture proof.
- If required hardware is unavailable, report `NOT TESTED` or `BLOCKED`.

## Focused stability programme

The active experiment design is intentionally small:

- `pentax-capture-stability-experiments.md`
- `pentax-capture-stability-experiments.schema.json`
- `pentax-physical-operative-runbook.md`
- `pentax-agent-operative-prompts.md`
- `pentax-k1ii-second-pass.md`
- `pentax-mode-aware-liveness.md`
- `../tests/README-pentax-stability.md`

The former 154-file `pentax-stability-*` planning package was preserved in the
private archive and removed from the active tree because it duplicated these
rules across many tiny, often superseded documents.

## Archived material

Raw logs, firmware-derived binaries, the fragmented stability package and the
local LM Studio review ledger were preserved before cleanup in the private
`ian-morgan99/PrivateResearch` repository:

`archives/BenroPolarisPatcher/2026-09-17-pre-context-cleanup/`

PrivateResearch archive commits: `a3dc491` (documentation and ledger) and
`8deab7e` (historical session state). Issue #116's second-stage research and
raw-evidence corpus is preserved at
`BenroPolaris/repository-hygiene-116/2026-09-18/original/`, commit `a6afa37`.

The archive contains both a commit-exact documentation tarball and a working-
tree tarball, per-file SHA-256 manifests and the pre-cleanup worktree patch.
See `ARCHIVED-EVIDENCE.md` for the public retention policy.
