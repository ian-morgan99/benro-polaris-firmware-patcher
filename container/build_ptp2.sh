# Cross-build the ptp2 camera driver from a chosen libgphoto2 release.
#   $1 = libgphoto2 version (e.g. 2.5.34)
#   $2 = trampoline address (hex, e.g. 0x0003fa00) — pgphoto's set_info_dirty
#   $3 = fix R5m2 typo (1/0)
#
# The driver is:
#   * soft-float EABI, glibc-2.24 ceiling (debian:9 arm-linux-gnueabi toolchain)
#   * linked against the device's OWN libexif/libltdl sonames (staged in /work/devlibs)
#   * built WITHOUT libxml2/jpeg/curl — the stock pgphoto's ptp2 links none of them,
#     and Canon USB capture needs none; this keeps the on-device dependency set minimal.

# FULLSTACK=1 : full-libgphoto2 mode (the DEFAULT of the patcher).  Builds the
# whole 2.5.34 stack -- core (libgphoto2.so.6) + port (libgphoto2_port.so.12) +
# ptp2 camlib + usb1 iolib -- so the on-disk trampoline loader can dlopen a fresh
# core/port instead of pgphoto's compiled-in 2.5.27 core.  Two fullstack-only
# build deltas vs the legacy ptp2-only path:
#   * NO trampoline shim: the ptp2-only path shims gp_filesystem_set_info_dirty
#     because the device's on-disk 2.5.27 core predates that symbol; the fullstack
#     NEW core exports it natively, so the shim is neither needed nor wanted.
#   * `_Camera` pad: pad struct _Camera to 4140 bytes so the new core's
#     gp_camera_new() calloc's the SAME size Benro's binary expects (Benro appended
#     a 4120-byte tail to _Camera; upstream is 20).  4120 is an interop SIZE, not
#     Benro code -- nothing proprietary is introduced.  ABI-inert for the library
#     (upstream never reads the tail).  See docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md.

#  them. On the R5 Mark II a couple of those `C_PTP(ptp_check_eos_events(...))` /
#  `CR(camera_keep_device_on(...))` drains return a transient non-OK the FIRST
#  time and abort init — the camera then falls back to the generic "USB PTP Class
#  Camera" driver (no settings, no live view). dbg_patch.py swallows exactly those
#  drains (config.c x13 + library.c keep_device_on x3 + check_eos_events x1) so
#  camera_init COMPLETES as the real Canon driver. It is the behaviour-only half
#  of trace_patch.py — NO fprintf tracing, NO new exported symbols / DT_NEEDED, a
#  no-op when the camera returns OK. This is a documented LGPL source modification
#  (see NOTICE). Idempotent; asserts exact anchor counts and aborts on drift.

# --- usb1 iolib (port/USB transport) -----------------------------------------
#  The stock on-disk usb1.so is a STANDARD libgphoto2 usb1 iolib built against
#  libusb-1.0 (its DT_NEEDED lists libusb-1.0.so.0, which the device ships in
#  /app/lib and pgphoto's port loader dlopen's at runtime — unlike ptp2, the
#  port layer is NOT statically dispatched). So the ABI-faithful replacement is
#  ALSO libusb-based, linked against the DEVICE's own libusb-1.0.so.0 soname
#  (staged by patch.sh in $DEV). We enable it here and harvest usb1.so below.
#
#  The device libusb-1.0.so.0 itself NEEDs libudev.so.1 (which lives in the
#  rootfs, not staged here). That only matters for configure's libusb_init
#  link-test; `-Wl,--allow-shlib-undefined` lets that test pass. usb1.so never
#  references any udev symbol, so udev does NOT enter usb1.so's own DT_NEEDED
#  (verified against stock in patch.sh).
#
#  usb1 is built ONLY when patch.sh staged the device libusb in $DEV (i.e. the
#  usb1 swap is enabled). Otherwise libusb-1.0 is explicitly turned OFF so the
#  build stays ptp2-only and byte-identical to the legacy path — even though the
#  image now ships libusb headers, they must not auto-enable a usb1 we can't link.
